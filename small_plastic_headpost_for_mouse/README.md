Small plastic headpost for mouse
=============

This headposts provides ease of use for extracellular recording or pure behaviour/opto experiments. The stability id nowhere near usable for any acute prep or imaging.
The design works best with a flexible/spring loaded mouse platform or with an air ball, so that the force on the headposts is minimized.

Materials needed: Screw and wing nut to hold the clamp to the holder. We had good results with teflon screws.

The holder itself can be made from any abs-like material, the headposts themselves need to be the highest possible strength.
We used APProto's 'sla xtreme' material with good results (http://www.approto.com/PDFs/Data-Sheets/SLA_XTREME_rev2.aspx).
Please add more suppliers here if you have tested others.

APProto sometimes has issues with scaling the .STL (usually by a factor of 10). The dimensions for the parts should be as follows. When getting a quote, choose mm as units (rather than inches):

Headpost_Clamp_thinner_inches.stl : 0.59" X 0.20" X 3.15" Vol=0.26" cubed

headpost_holder_for_noga_3_8_inch_clamp : 2.49" X 1.51" X 0.95" Vol=0.79" cubed
